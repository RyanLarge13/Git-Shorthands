# Git-Shorthands

Git Shorthands was built to make some of the longer git commands even easier than they already are...

So far the code written for this repo works only on linux terminals 

**~/ gs clone ${REPO NAME}**

***Clone remote repository***

You will be asked if you would like to install project dependencies from the
root directory of your project after cloning from a repository 

*the package manager set in configuration will be used*

**~/ gs init ${NAME OF REMOTE REPO}**

***Initialize your local repository and push all changes to remote repository***

This command only works if a repository exists remotely
